## Instructions
- Copy the example YAML files to your ESPHome directory in Home Assistant
- Fill out individual data in the secrets.yaml file (SSID, password, etc.)
- Optionally comment sensors you don't need or uncomment sensors you do need

## Configuration variables:
- **uart_id** (*Optional*, ID): Manually specify the ID of the UART hub.
- **flow_control_pin** (*Optional*, Pin): The pin used to switch the direction of the MAX485 transceiver. Defaults to GPIO4.
- **inverter_status** (*Optional*): Status code of the inverter (0: offline, 1: online, 2: error, 99: waiting for response)
- **phase_a** (*Optional*): Sensors related to first phase of the inverter
  - **current** (*Optional*): Current flowing to the grid (A)
  - **voltage** (*Optional*): Grid voltage (V)
  - **active_power** (*Optional*): Power delivered to the grid (W)
  - **frequency** (*Optional*): Grid frequency (Hz)
- **phase_b** (*Optional*): Sensors related to second phase of the inverter
  - See **phase_a**
- **phase_c** (*Optional*): Sensors related to third phase of the inverter
  - See **phase_a**

- **pv1** (*Optional*): Sensors related to the first group PV cells
  - **current** (*Optional*): Current flowing from PV1 (A)
  - **voltage** (*Optional*): PV1 Voltage (V)
  - **active_power** (*Optional*): PV1 power production (W)
- **pv2** (*Optional*): Sensors related to the second group PV cells
  - See **pv1**
- **pv3** (*Optional*): Sensors related to the third group PV cells
  - See **pv1**
- **pv4** (*Optional*): Sensors related to the fourth group PV cells
  - See **pv1**

- **total_energy_production** (*Optional*): Total energy produced during lifetime of inverter (kWh)
- **energy_production_day** (*Optional*): Total energy produced today (kWh)
- **generation_power** (*Optional*): Current total power generation (W)
- **grid_power** (*Optional*): Current export power to grid. Required to have a meter connected to the inverter (SDM230). (W)
- **loads_power** (*Optional*): (W)
- **inverter_temp** (*Optional*): Inverter temperature (°C)
- **boost_temp** (*Optional*): Boost temperature (°C)
- **ambient_temp** (*Optional*): Ambient temperature (°C)
- **protocol_version** (*Optional*): FoxESS communication protocol version reported by the inverter
- **serial_number** (*Optional*): Inverter serial number from heartbeat frames; configured only when you want to expose it in Home Assistant

## Hardware setup
The hardware setup including a wiring diagram can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/assembly12/Foxess-T-series-ESPHome-Home-Assistant/wiki/Hardware-setup).

Designing a custom pcb and enclosure is next on my to do list. I'll update here with the corresponding gerber and stl files when done.

There is some more info being send (like error messages and so on), however this is really not to usefull so I left it out of this component.

Some basic electronics skills (like soldering) are needed to realize this project. I do not take any responsibility for the use of this custom component or anything that it written down in this repository. Use at your own risk.
